This project forms part of my undergraduate thesis and focuses on time series forecasting for commodity prices. Specifically, it aims to predict future rice prices using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, a well-established statistical method for analyzing and forecasting time-dependent data.

The project involves:

Collecting and cleaning historical rice price data

Performing exploratory data analysis to identify trends and seasonality

Building and tuning the ARIMA model

Generating forecasts and visualizing the results

The goal is to demonstrate how classical statistical models like ARIMA can be applied to real-world economic data for practical forecasting tasks. This project highlights skills in time series analysis, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization using Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib
